Over the course of eight lectures in November, our first cohort will receive an introductory education across a spectrum of P2P theories, concepts, and technologies. As we start to wrap up the application period for our first cohort, we reflected on the founding values of the program and our approach to supporting diversity in the P2P space."),u("p",null,"Last year, we recognized a strange juxtaposition: the drive of the peer-to-peer community to subvert the dominant norms of today runs contradictory to the insulated, homogeneous people we see building and creating within this community. We could see that the growth within the P2P space - largely within the blockchain domain - mirrored a similar lack of diversity so often cited in the greater tech sector.

When we talk about participants in the P2P community, whether from a technical or cultural standpoint, there are common motivations: to challenge centralized web services, subvert business models and governance structures, and increase support for \u201cthe commons.\u201d And these ambitions require experts and curious individuals who have comprehensive experience in the systems that P2P systems attempt to change. These individuals are intimately aware of the flaws in these systems, understand their community or users\u2019 needs, and can act as an important translator for stakeholders outside P2P.

The normalization and adoption of P2P technologies, afterall, depends on the diversity of those creating them. So, what could we create that could help transition more people - coming from different industries, backgrounds, and perspectives - into the P2P space?

Alongside of the cohort, we plan to design an asynchronous infrastructure for communication and support between those involved with AccessP2P. Furthermore, all lecture presentations, additional readings, and videos will be posted online for general public access."),u("p",null,"In an effort to keep the program accessible, we designed the lectures to require only a limited knowledge of programming by focusing on curating high-level introductions to the projects, technologies, philosophies, and people involved in the P2P space.
