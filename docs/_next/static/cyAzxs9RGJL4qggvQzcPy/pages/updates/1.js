We could see that the growth within the P2P space - largely within the blockchain domain - mirrored a similar lack of diversity so often cited in the greater tech sector.

When we talk about participants in the P2P community, whether from a technical or cultural standpoint, there are common motivations: to challenge centralized web services, subvert business models and governance structures, and increase support for \u201cthe commons.\u201d And these ambitions require experts and curious individuals who have comprehensive experience in the systems that P2P systems attempt to change.
